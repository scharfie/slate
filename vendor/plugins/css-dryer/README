# CssDryer -- Eliminate Repetition In Your Stylesheets


## Introduction

Cascading style sheets (CSS) are wonderful but repetitive.  Rails strongly discourages repetition, the don't repeat yourself (DRY) principle, so writing CSS feels ungainly in Rails.

There are two sources of repetition in CSS:

* nested selectors
* lack of variables

Nested selectors lead to CSS like this:

  div           { font-family: Verdana; }
  div#content   { background-color: green; }
  div#content p { color: red; }

Note the triple repetition of <code>div</code> and the double repetition of <code>#content</code>.

The lack of variables leads to CSS like this:

  .sidebar { border: 1px solid #fefefe; }
  .content { color: #fefefe; }

Note the repeated colour <code>#fefefe</code>.

The CssDryer eliminates both of these sources allowing you to write DRY, pleasing stylesheets.  The examples above become:

  <% dark_grey = '#fefefe' %>

  div {
    font-family: Verdana;
    #content {
      background-color: green;
      p { color: red; }
    }
  }

  .sidebar { border: 1 px solid <%= dark_grey %>; }
  .content { color: <%= dark_grey %>; }

Note, though, that <code>@media</code> blocks are preserved.  For example:

  @media screen, projection {
    div {font-size:100%;}
  }

is left unchanged.

The original whitespace is preserved as much as possible.

See CssDryer for more details.


## Which Selectors Are Supported?

The CssDryer handles nested descendant, child, adjacent, class, pseudo-class, attribute and id selectors.

Multiple comma separated selectors are now supported.


## Comments

Comments on nested selectors do not get 'flattened' or de-nested with their selector.  For example comment B will be left inside the html selector below:

Before:

  /* Comment A */
  html {
    /* Comment B */
    p {
      color: blue;
    }
  }

After:

  /* Comment A */
  html {
    /* Comment B */
  }
  html p {
      color: blue;
    }
  }

This is suboptimal but I hope not too inconvenient.

Please also note that commas in comments will sometimes be replaced with a space.  This is due to a shameful hack in the code that handles comma-separated selectors.


## Partials

You may use partial nested stylesheets as you would with normal templates.  For example, assuming your controller(s) set the @user variable and a User has a background colour (red):

app/views/stylesheets/site.ncss:

  body {
    color: blue;
    <%= render :partial => 'content', :locals => {:background => @user.background} %>
  }

app/views/stylesheets/_content.ncss:

  div#content {
    background: <%= background %>;
    margin: 10px;
  }

And all this would render to site.css:

  body {
    color: blue;
  }
  body div#content {
    background: red;
    margin: 10px;
  }


## Installation

Pre-requisite: Rails 2.

First, install in the usual Rails way.  From your application's directory:

  $ script/plugin install http://opensource.airbladesoftware.com/trunk/plugins/css_dryer

Second, generate the stylesheets controller and helper, and a test nested stylesheet:

  $ script/generate css_dryer

Third, add a named route to your config/routes.rb:

  map.stylesheets 'stylesheets/:action.:format', :controller => 'stylesheets'

Verify that everything is working by visiting this URL:

  http://0.0.0.0:3000/stylesheets/test.css

You should see this output:

  body {
    color: blue;
  }
  body p {
    color: red;
  }
    

## Usage

You put your stylesheets, DRY or otherwise, in <code>app/views/stylesheets/</code>.  Once rendered they will be cached in <code>public/stylesheets/</code>.

DRY stylesheet files should have a <code>ncss</code> extension -- think 'n' for nested.  For example, <code>site.ncss</code>.

Get them in your views with a <code>css</code> extension like this:

    <link href='/stylesheets/site.css' rel='Stylesheet' type='text/css'>

or with Rails' <code>stylesheet_link_tag</code> helper:

    <%= stylesheet_link_tag 'site' %>


## To Do

* Package as a gem as well as a plugin.
* Merb compatibility.
* Split out a separate EXAMPLES document.
* Replace regexp-based nested-stylesheet parser with a Treetop parser.
* Make CssDryer work with Rails' asset packaging.


## Alternatives

* [RCSS][1]: ERB, server-side constants, server-side classes and command line execution.  No nesting as such, though server-side classes offer a form of inheritance.

* [DCSS][2] (written up [here][3]): server-side constants, different syntax.  Descendant selectors only.

* [Styleaby][4] creates CSS with Ruby syntax.  "An experimental, unauthorized mashup of Scott Barron's stillborn Builder::CSS templates and Why The Lucky Stiff's Markaby templates."

* [Dirt Simple .rcss Templates][5] by Josh Susser.  No nesting, just variables.

## Credits

The idea came from John Nunemaker on [Rails Tips][6].  John beta-tested the code, provided a test case for @media blocks and suggested the controller's body.  Thanks John!

The caching code is based on [Topfunky's][7].

Changing the controller's name to <code>stylesheets</code>, thus allowing one to use Rails' <code>stylesheet_link_tag</code> helper, occurred to me while reading Josh Susser's [Dirt Simple .rcss Templates][5].  Once I noticed it, I realised everybody was using a <code>StylesheetsController</code>.  Doh!
